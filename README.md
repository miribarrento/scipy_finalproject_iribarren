# Ethogram 2.0

## Overview

**Ethogram 2.0** is an ongoing project that explores the intersection of **ethology** and **machine learning methodologies**. This project aims to provide a structured approach to analyzing animal behavior using computational techniques while ensuring **methodological and ecological validity**.

## Objectives

- 📌 **Review and analyze** computational approaches for studying animal behavior.
- 📊 **Examine datasets** and benchmarks used in computational ethology.
- 🤖 **Explore AI-driven methodologies** for improving behavioral annotation.

## Data Sources

This project is based on:

- **Hoffmann et al. (2024)**: *A Benchmark for Computational Analysis of Animal Behavior Using Animal-Borne Tags*.
- **Bio-logger Ethogram Benchmark**: Used for exploratory data analysis and future testing machine learning models.

## Methodology

1. 🔍 **Data Exploration**  
   - Understanding the structure and features of behavioral datasets.
   
2. 📊 **Benchmark Analysis**  
   - Evaluating existing methodologies and challenges in behavioral annotation.
   
4. 🌍 **Computational Ethology Framework**  
   - To be continued
