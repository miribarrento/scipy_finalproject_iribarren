Ethogram 2.0

Overview

Ethogram 2.0 is a research-driven project that explores the intersection of ethology (the study of animal behavior) and machine learning methodologies. This project aims to provide a structured approach to analyzing animal behavior using computational techniques while ensuring methodological rigor and ecological validity.

Objectives

Review and analyze computational approaches for studying animal behavior.

Examine datasets and benchmarks used in computational ethology.

Implement machine learning techniques to classify and interpret behavioral patterns.

Explore the potential of AI-driven methodologies for improving behavioral annotation.

Data Sources

The project is based on:

Hoffmann et al. (2024): A Benchmark for Computational Analysis of Animal Behavior Using Animal-Borne Tags.

Human Behavior Dataset: Used for exploratory data analysis and testing machine learning models.

Methodology

Data Exploration: Understanding the structure and features of behavioral datasets.

Machine Learning & Deep Learning: Applying classification models to identify behavioral patterns.

Benchmark Analysis: Evaluating existing methodologies and challenges in behavioral annotation.

Computational Ethology Framework: Aligning data properties with analytical techniques for enhanced ecological research.
